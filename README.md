# Library Management System

The Library Management System is a simple tool to manage books in a library. Using this system, you can add, view, search, and remove books. It also allows you to check the availability of books. This project was created to practice my Java skills, particularly Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and hashing, and is built with Java Swing for the GUI.

## Features

- *Add Books*: You can add books by specifying the book name, author, ISBN, genre, and publication year.
- *Manage Books*: View and manage the entire book list in a detailed report.
- *Search Books*: Use the search bar to find books by title, author, or ISBN.
- *Remove Books*: Easily remove books from the system.
- *Check Availability*: Check if a book is available in the library.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Ensure you have [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk15-downloads.html) installed on your system.
3. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse,VScode).
4. Run the program to launch the Library Management System GUI.

## Usage

1. The main window will display the available functionalities such as adding books, searching, viewing the book list, and checking availability.
2. Use the "Add Book" option to input book details such as name, author, ISBN, genre, and publication year.
3. View and manage all added books using the book list feature, which shows a detailed report.
4. Search for specific books using the search bar, where you can find books by title, author, or ISBN.
5. You can also remove books from the library system or check their availability with just a click.

## Technologies Used

- *Java*: Core programming language used to build the backend logic.
- *Java Swing*: Used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
- *OOP Concepts*: Applied to design the structure of the system, including classes for books and operations.
- *Hashing*: Utilized to store and retrieve book information efficiently.
